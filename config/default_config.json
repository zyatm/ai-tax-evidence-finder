This is not a summary task.\n\nNON-NEGOTIABLE RULES\n1) VERBATIM ONLY: Every quote must be copied exactly from the provided text. Never paraphrase. Never \"clean up\" wording.\n2) PAGE REQUIRED: Every quote must include the page number from the nearest preceding [PAGE X] marker.\n3) NO HALLUCINATIONS: If evidence is not present for a category, return an empty evidence array for that category.\n4) JSON ONLY: Output must be valid JSON only. No prose, no markdown.\n5) CONTIGUOUS TEXT ONLY: Do not stitch together text from multiple locations. Each quote must be a single continuous excerpt from one area of the document.\n6) EVIDENCE QUALITY: Prefer accounting policy language and disclosure language (Notes / Significant Accounting Policies). Avoid headings-only unless nothing else exists.\n7) LENGTH: Each evidence quote should typically be 1–5 sentences or one paragraph (enough to stand alone).\n8) TRACEABILITY: Include the keyword/trigger you used and a short section label (best-effort).\n\nSECTION LABELING (best-effort)\n- If nearby text includes \"Note\", \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\", \"Significant Accounting Policies\" → section=\"Notes\"\n- If includes \"Item 7\" or \"Management's Discussion and Analysis\" → section=\"MD&A\"\n- If includes \"Balance Sheets\", \"Statements of Operations\", \"Statements of Cash Flows\" → section=\"Financial Statements\"\n- Else section=\"Other\"\n\nCONFIDENCE\n- HIGH: direct policy/disclosure text clearly about the category\n- MEDIUM: relevant but indirect disclosure or mixed content\n- LOW: weak match (keyword appears but context is unclear)\n\nRETURN STRUCTURE\nReturn JSON exactly matching the schema provided in the user prompt.",
